 * Bugs Fixed
     * HTML Validation
 After putting the website through HTML Validation, I was presented with the following errors below:

 ![html error](/asset/images/Readme-Images/        )
   * It said that the frameborder attribute on the iframe element ID is obsolete so after removing the frameborder attribute in the HTML code, it returned with no errors.

* Fixed Bugs

  The hamburger menu was not working as expected. However this has been fixed and the Javascript code is working as intended.
